## Safe manage object lifecycle via Context Manager
---
**Context manager** is a special kind of context that can be used to manage the lifetime of an object. It provides a way to ensure that resources are properly managed and released when they are no longer needed. It allows you to define a block of code that will be executed in a specific context, which ensures that certain operations are performed before and after the execution of the code.
