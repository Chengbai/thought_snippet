## Safe manage object lifecycle via Context Manager
---
**Context manager** is a special kind of context that can be used to manage the lifetime of an object. It provides a way to ensure that resources are properly managed and released when they are no longer needed. It allows you to define a block of code that will be executed in a specific context, which ensures that certain operations are performed before and after the execution of the code.

## No-op
---
A **no-op layer** (short for "no operation layer") is a layer in a neural network or computational graph that performs no actual transformation on its inputâ€”it simply passes the data through unchanged.

## Chunked-prefill
---
**Chunked prefill** is a technique for processing long prompt sequences in large language models (LLMs) by breaking the prefill phase into smaller chunks rather than processing the entire prompt at once.

## KV-cache
---
 **KV-cache** (Key-Value cache) is a memory optimization technique used in transformer models to avoid redundant computations during autoregressive generation at inference stage.
