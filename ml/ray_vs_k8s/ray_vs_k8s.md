# Thought: Ray v.s K8S
---

**Ray cluster** and **Kubernetes cluster** serve different purposes, though they can work together:
- **Kubernetes (k8s) cluster** is a **container orchestration platform** that manages the lifecycle of containerized applications. It handles deployment, scaling, networking, and resource allocation across machines. It's general-purpose infrastructure for running any containerized workload.
- **Ray cluster** is a **distributed computing framework** specifically designed for ML/AI workloads like training, inference, hyperparameter tuning, and reinforcement learning. It provides:

  - Distributed task scheduling and execution
  - Built-in libraries for ML (Ray Train, Ray Tune, Ray Serve, Ray Data)
  - Shared memory and efficient data handling between workers
  - Actor model for stateful computations

Key differences:
- **Abstraction level**: K8s manages containers and pods; Ray manages Python functions, classes, and data at the application level.
- Use case: K8s is for deploying and managing services; Ray is for distributed computation and ML workflows.
- Relationship: They're complementary, not competing. You typically run Ray on top of Kubernetes using the **KubeRay operator**. K8s handles the infrastructure (nodes, networking, pod lifecycle), while Ray handles the distributed computation logic.
- For ML workflows: Ray is more ergonomic because it's purpose-built for distributed Python workloads. You can do things like **@ray.remote** decorators and have **seamless data sharing between workers**. With pure K8s, you'd need to manually handle inter-pod communication, data serialization, and task scheduling.
- **In practice for ML teams**: use K8s as your cluster infrastructure, and Ray as your distributed computing framework running on top of it. This gives you K8s's operational benefits (auto-scaling, monitoring, multi-tenancy) with Ray's ML-friendly APIs.
